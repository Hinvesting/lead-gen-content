Project Objective:
Generate a complete, production-ready, single-page landing page using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The primary goal of the page is to capture user emails for a free tool called the "Multi-Content Generator" and send the data to a specified webhook.

Style Guide:

Theme: Dark

Background Color: Dark midnight blue (#2C3E50).

Text Color: White for primary text, light gray (#bdc3c7) for secondary text.

Accent Color: Vibrant gold (#F1C40F) for all buttons and icon backgrounds.

Fonts: Use "Montserrat" for all headings and "Open Sans" for all body text.

File Structure and Assets:

At the root of the project, create a public directory.

Inside public, create two sub-directories: images and videos.

The code you generate must reference the following assets at these exact paths. The user will manually upload these files after you create the structure.

Logo: /images/logo.png

Creator Image: /images/sam-stacks-creator.png

Demo Video: /videos/demo.mp4

Page Content and Layout (In Order):

Header: A centered, medium-sized logo (h-16 or approx. 96px tall) using /images/logo.png.

Hero Section: A centered section with a bold headline, sub-headline, and CTA button.

Headline: Stop Staring at a Blank Page. Start Generating Daily Content in 5 Minutes.

Sub-headline: Get our free Multi-Content Generator that uses AI to brainstorm, write, and organize a week of social media content for you. 100% Free.

CTA Button: A large, solid gold button that says Get the Free Tool Now.

Demo Video Section: A centered <video> tag referencing /videos/demo.mp4. The video must be configured to autoplay, loop, and muted. It should have rounded corners and a subtle border.

Features Section: A 3-column layout with circular gold icon backgrounds.

Feature 1: Lightbulb icon. Headline: Endless Ideas. Text: Generate unique angles and topics for your niche on demand.

Feature 2: Robot icon. Headline: Automated Writing. Text: Create engaging social media copy, hashtags, and titles in seconds.

Feature 3: Calendar icon. Headline: Effortless Organization. Text: Keep all your content perfectly organized inside a simple Google Sheet.

Creator Section: This section must contain only the single, centered image referencing /images/sam-stacks-creator.png. Do not add any extra text or columns.

Final CTA Section: A centered section with the headline Your Audience is Waiting. and a solid gold button that says Download Your Free Generator.

Footer: A simple footer with the copyright text Â© 2025 New Money Millionaires L.L.C. All rights reserved. and placeholder links for "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service".

Interactivity and Functionality:

Popup Modal: Both CTA buttons must trigger a popup modal for email submission. The modal must include an "X" icon to close it.

Form Submission: The form inside the modal must have an async handleSubmit function that, on submit, sends a POST request with the user's email in a JSON body to this exact Make.com webhook URL: https://hook.us1.make.com/43i0zrryriegg6grhe995mveumvpwi. After a successful submission, show an alert to the user and close the modal.
